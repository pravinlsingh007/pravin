• Modification to PSA to have two drop down boxes for the template selection instead of one.  The first will be the template size (same as SPF) where you choose  Large Adhesive, Small Adhesive, XL Feature Card, etc.  The second drop down will get populated with a subset of the template list which only will show the templates for the size that was selected in the first drop down.	Need modification in the create and Edit Sign screen for template selection.
Currently there is only one drop down for the template type. To Add the Template size and Template name may need changes to the database. For template  dropdown new table and mapping needs to be create if not present.	No any previous issues will be resolved on the screen. If there are two different tables for Template Size and Template for dropdown then it will be the data fetch and display only.
• Visual Signage will receive alert through the Promotional Sign App when a deal has been deleted, modified or added – this one is to give more details on the track changes page in PSA.   If a linkage has been modified, then Visual wants to know what specifically has changed.  Same with the price changes.  In discussing this with Shena, it seems that if we can make the change description a hyperlink on the ‘deal linkage has been modified’ and ‘price change’ types, then when clicked, these could show details of what was changed.	1)Need to modify the track changes screen to add Hyperlink for the specific condition 
2) New screen needs to be created to display detail on click of hyperlink created.	No any previous issues will be resolved on the screen.
• Modification to PSA to add an item number search to the search page – The search should be based on the linkages that are connected to the sign so that item based signs as well as category based signs will be retrieved.	Need to modify the search screen to add the Item Number search. 
Search the signs on the basis of Item Number is bulky  process as one item can be associated with no of linkages and many linkages are associated with many signs.	No any previous issues will be resolved on the screen.
• Changing & making adjustments to the large and small size adhesive promotional templates to accommodate new template layout for new vinyl store promotional sign stock (this was already estimated)	Only Template changes is required. No changes to the PSA
